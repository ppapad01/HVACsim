# HVACsim-toolkit

The HVACsim-toolkit is an open-source software, originally developed by the KIOS Research Center for Intelligent Systems and Networks of the University of Cyprus which operates within the Matlab environment, for simulating HVAC system of a building using gbXML file. The gbXML files can be exported from Revit building designs (.rvt) by generating energy simulation in the menu Analyze.

The HVACsim-toolkit features easy to use modeling, simulating and plotting results of HVAC systems using Buidling design projects in Revit.


# Requirements

Matlab


# How to use the Toolkit

Download the folder Download ZIP, set the run path in Matlab within the saved folder, and run RunTests.m. This will execute all the commands which have been implemented in the Class.

Example:



# How to fix/report bugs

To fix a bug Fork the HVACsim Toolkit, Edit the code and make the appropriate change, and then Pull it so that we evaluate it.

Keep in mind that some bugs may exist in the gbXML, in case you are not receiving the expected results.
